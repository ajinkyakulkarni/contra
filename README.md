# Contra #

Contra is a a programming language that I written from scratch
while I was writing my book
[Practical Interpreter Construction](https://leanpub.com/pic)

Contra is ideal for studying interpreter construction that it has
tokenizer, parser and interpreter. I consciously keep it simple
to make my book's readers able to understand the internals.

## Example Application ##

There is a simple expense management application in sample folder.
Have a look expense-add.con and expense-report.con scripts in sample folder.

Here is an example output:

```
